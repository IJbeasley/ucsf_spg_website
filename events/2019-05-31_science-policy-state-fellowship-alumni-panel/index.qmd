Join the Science Policy Group and the Office of Career & Professional Development for the second in our science policy fellowship series, which will focus on state-level fellowships. This event will feature a panel of current and former fellows of the California Council on Science & Technology (CCST) Science Fellows Program, which places fellows in the California legislature in Sacramento. The event will be a great chance both to get advice if you are interested in applying for a fellowship and to hear about career options in science policy and beyond.
