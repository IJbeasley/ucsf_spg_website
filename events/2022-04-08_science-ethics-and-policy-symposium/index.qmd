The Science Policy Groups at UCSF and UC Berkeley hosted the largest student-run interdisciplinary Science Ethics & Policy Symposium, "From Plants to Privacy: Science Ethics for the Modern Era"! This event explored the unintended consequences of new science and technology. How can innovation exacerbate economic or racial inequity? How does novel science and tech impact every community, especially those whose perspectives have been historically overlooked? Check out our SEPS 2022 panel recordings for a look into these hard-hitting discussions on the ethical ramifications of innovative tools like CRISPR, artificial intelligence, and big data collection!
