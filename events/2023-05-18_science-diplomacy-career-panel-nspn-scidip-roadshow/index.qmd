This Science Diplomacy Career Panel will feature local SF diplomats from four representative countries (United Kingdom, Japan, Chile, Switzerland). Our panel is co-hosted by the National Science Policy Network (NSPN), as part of their wider Science Diplomacy Roadshow held in various cities across the USA. The event will feature a 1-hour moderated panel discussion plus audience Q&A and followed by a networking reception with refreshments. If you have ever wondered what science diplomacy entails, which skills you would need for a diplomatic career, or how scientific collaborations operate on an international scale, this is an excellent opportunity to learn more and network with local diplomats and NSPN members.
