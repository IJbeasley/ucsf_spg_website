Online panel discussion with STEM student groups that are leading Covid response efforts in their communities. Attendees will gain an understanding of what groups are doing, as well as the lessons theyâ€™ve learned on how to be most effective. We hope attendees will leave inspired to begin their own efforts to assist their communities in COVID response.
