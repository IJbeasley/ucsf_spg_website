For the first time in over a century in San Francisco, this year’s election is an open race with four visionary new candidates. Come hear the candidates talk about issues such as mental health, mass incarceration, violence as a health issue, and whatever other issues YOU can think of. Questions will be community/audience-submitted! This is a non-partisan event, as such there will be no campaign literature, buttons, or promotional materials permitted in the auditorium.
