### Speakers  
SPG members

For Event 4, Sacramento Advocacy Day, SPG took our advocacy teams to meet with legislators in Sacramento. In addition to meetings with lawmakers, our SPG members learned about the State Capitol and the legislative process from a California Council on Science and Technology (CCST) fellow, and afterward discussed their advocacy experiences during a debriefing dinner. All of our advocacy teams had productive meetings and a successful overall trip. SPG members met with over 20 legislators/staff, distributed one-pagers to several additional offices, and even attended a press conference with Senator Scott Wiener. At least two of our teams have maintained contact with Senator Wienerâ€™s office, through email and Twitter, and hope to inform upcoming legislation based on their scientific expertise.
