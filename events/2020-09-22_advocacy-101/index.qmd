### Speakers  
UCSF Government Relations, Tom Pospiech (UCSF SPG)

On National Voter Registration Day, learn how to engage in advocacy, best practices for doing so, and guidelines for how to engage with UCSF and on personal time. UCSF is committed to encouraging civic participation throughout our campus and community. Building upon UCSF's voter engagement initiative launched in 2019, there has been an increased interest in advocacy at UCSF. Coupled with the challenges of voting during the pandemic and the current political climate, the General Election presents us with an opportunity to increase engagement and empower our community.
