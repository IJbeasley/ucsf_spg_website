These SPG leaders will also join Dr. Keith Yamamoto (Vice Chancellor of Science Policy and Strategy), Dr. Ben Rubin (Associate Director of Precision Medicine), and Eric Anthony (Director of Federal Government Relations) in meetings with congressional offices to advocate for federal support for biomedical research and training.\n\nSneha Rao and Elysse Phillips, two graduate students in the Weiner Lab at UCSF, study pre-implantation mouse embryo development to understand implantation defects in embryos of advanced maternal age. They will discuss how this research could reduce infertility and inform advancements to stem cell-based embryo models that can provide critical insight into early human development and disease. They aim to highlight why we need a new regulatory framework to keep up with rapidly advancing embryo models.\nDaniel Sprague and Dan Karmelic, a Neuroscience researcher in the Foco Lab and postdoc in the Davis Lab, will explore why and how they use the humble C. elegans worm to answer fundamental neuroscience questions. They will zoom in on a fascinating study where worms were used to understand the role sleep may play in long term memory formation. Rashmi Chandra, lead author of this study and postdoc in the L’Etoile Lab, will join Daniel and Dan in presenting this work. They hope to demonstrate why investment in basic science is essential towards advancing our understanding of the human brain and what goes wrong in diseases that affect memory such as Alzheimer’s Disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

How can we address the gross disparities in access to vaccine technology and other therapeutics that resulted between Global North and South? What might an international collaborative approach to science look like? These cross-disciplinary conversations will explore the logistics of vaccine research, production, and distribution with attention to how legacies of global imperialism and intellectual property law have shaped who ultimately has access to lifesaving technologies. When Jonas Salk developed one of the first polio vaccines, he affirmed it as public domain. When asked who owned the patent to the vaccine, he replied “Well, the people, I would say. There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?”. We invoke Salk’s rhetorical question to create an opening to reconsider our current trajectory and next steps for vaccine distribution.\n\nAchal Prabhala, a longtime advocate for equitable access to medicine in the Global South, will present a brief history of intellectual patent law and discuss its impact on the distribution of mRNA vaccines through the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\nFlyer for Vaccine Equity Series Session 1: The Covid Vaccine Fiasco (2022-09-29)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Designed to train scientists to engage with policymaking of all levels, this mini-course is a first step for anyone interested in science policy. We will focus on two core competencies: (1) knowledge of the policymaking process and (2) rhetorical skills for communicating with a variety of audiences, with special attention given to how these skills can be used in advocacy and social justice work. Each student will apply these skills to build a policy portfolio with an elevator pitch, letter to the editor, and policy brief on a selected science policy topic. This course is intended for students on any career trajectory and will provide opportunities to interact with expert guest speakers in a variety of career paths.\nWe will be sharing some resources compiled from the minicourse.
