### **Advocacy** {.heading-up}

Beyond hosting events at UCSF, we advocate for issues we care about directly to people in power.

#### **Advocacy training**

We have hosted a variety of workshops to prepare members with no prior experience to visit the State Capitol and advocate for an issue of their choice, including an Advocacy 101 workshop, a Civic Engagement workshop series, and a policy Memo Writing workshop.

#### **Advocacy opportunities**

In addition to phone banking campaigns, we have organized advocacy visits to the CA State Capitol in Sacramento and have participated in the March For Science (D.C.) and CASE workshops.
