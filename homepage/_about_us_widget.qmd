### Who are we?

SPG at UCSF serves as a platform for discussing science policy issues, providing resources & training for science policy education, and initiating advocacy within and beyond UCSF.

Our events and projects are entirely shaped by the interests of our incredible leadership members!

Example topics include:

-   Research funding
-   Vaccine equity
-   Criminal legal system policy
-   Drug policy/harm reduction
-   Gender equity

### What do we do?

#### **Professional Development** 

Our professional development events help prepare our members to engage with policy as scientists, whether as a potential career or as a supplementary interest.

#### **Skill building**

We have held workshops on communication and advocacy skills, including effective use of social media and persuasive writing for elected officials and the public.

#### **Policy career exploration**

We have invited speakers to discuss their careers in science policy fields and help our members follow in their footsteps.

### Advocacy

Beyond hosting events at UCSF, we advocate for issues we care about directly to people in power.

#### **Advocacy training**

We have hosted a variety of workshops to prepare members with no prior experience to visit the State Capitol and advocate for an issue of their choice, including an Advocacy 101 workshop, a Civic Engagement workshop series, and a policy Memo Writing workshop.

#### **Advocacy opportunities** 

In addition to phone banking campaigns, we have organized advocacy visits to the CA State Capitol in Sacramento and have participated in the March For Science (D.C.) and CASE workshops.

### **Community Engagement**

Many of our best and biggest events aim to engage the public.

#### **Mutual aid**

Our biggest mutual aid action was a year-long Clean Hands project, where we distributed 2,200+ gallons of hand sanitizer in over 62,000 bottles to CA jails/prisons, the Navajo Nation and other underserved COVID-vulnerable communities.

#### Engaging with the democratic process

We have moderated the 2019 Last District Attorney debate, provided information about voting and voter registration, and hosted ballot measure pros & cons sessions.

#### **Community education**

We have provided many opportunities for the public to learn more about science and science policy, including a public screening of the documentary "Human Nature" and a series of panels about controversial “Hard Questions” like defunding the police and SF’s housing crisis.
